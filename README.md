## About me

Hi, I am Tobias!

Professionally, I work on optimizing websites and my company [Audisto](https://audisto.com/) develops software for analyzing and monitoring websites and offers it as a SaaS solution.

In my private life, I like to get involved with [Freifunk Berlin](https://berlin.freifunk.net/en/), a wireless community mesh network, where I help develop the firmware, work on the website and also look after various locations. In 2024, I was a mentor at the Google Summer of Code for Freifunk Berlin.

If you want to know more about me head over to my [personal website](https://www.tobias-schwarz.com/en/).
